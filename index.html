                    A hotel reservation system works by processing secure online reservations made through a hotel’s
                    website.

                    The data is then passed onto a backend system which can be accessed by hotels to manage bookings.
                    Other features may come with it – for example, the automation of reservation confirmation emails.

                    Small hotel managers and owners recognize that technology is key to growing their business and
                    increasing their bookings overtime.

                    To sell rooms to capacity and to appeal to a global audience, a hotel reservation system is
                    required.
